title: Numbers, dates, and times
---

These three elements form the core that drives our business. Customers rely on numerical data to gauge how well their systems are performing while dates and time provide much needed context for that information.

## Basics

-   Write numbers as numerals regardless of where they appear in a sentence
-   Use commas for numbers with 4 or more digits.
-   If absolute numerical accuracy is less important than giving customers a sense of the number, it’s OK to round them to something like 1k (for 1,012) or 324.5 million (for 324,501,082). Use your best judgment with this one.
-   Never write whole numbers with a decimal place and trailing zero.

## Large numbers

We use common American English for our UI, which creates some challenges with large numbers. International and American English conventions for thousand are the same: a lowercase k. But million, billion, and trillion are trickier because abbreviations differ across regions and industries. For this reason, we abbreviate only thousand, our most common count.

-   Abbreviate thousand with a lowercase k with no space between the the last number and the letter: 50k.
-   When dealing with larger numbers, use a space and then spell out million, billion, trillion, etc, in lowercase. If space is too tight and you have to abbreviate, use B, M, T, but only if you provide the full spelling elsewhere on the screen or chart and the full number on hover.
-   If possible, provide the full number on hover.

| In the UI     | On hover (wherever possible) | Don't         |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| 50.2k         | 50,200                       | 50.2 k        |
| 50.2 million  | 50,200,000                   | 50.2m, 50.2M  |
| 50.2 billion  | 50,200,000,000               | 50.2G, 50.2B  |
| 50.2 trillion | 50,200,000,000,000           | 50.2T, 50.2 t |

## Dates

-   Write dates with either the full month or a 3 letter month followed by the day number.
-   Include the 4-digit year wherever possible to clarify dates for international markets where we don't localize. If the year is already obvious, leave it off.
-   Don’t use ordinal indicators like 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.
-   Don't use number-only dates like 12/5/2019, as these don't mean the same thing to many international users.
-   Use an en dash (option + -) with a single space on each side when displaying date ranges.

| Do                          | Don't                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| August 21, 2019             | August 21                   |
| Jul 21, 2019                | Jul 21st, 2019 or 7/21/2019 |
| Jul 19, 2019 – Sep 12, 2019 | Jul 19, 2019–Sep 21, 2019   |

## Time

-   Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm.
-   Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am).
-   Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10.
-   When combining date and time, use a comma to separate them after the date.
-   If you have to include a time zone, use UTC as the default, and add it after am/pm.

**EXCEPTION** - When pinpoint accuracy is necessary, as with logs, you can use the 24-hour clock in the format HH:MM:SS.000, going down to the millisecond, if necessary.

| Do                                              | Don't                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 10:00pm                                         | 22:00pm                 |
| 1:30pm                                          | 01:30 PM                |
| August 25, 1:30pm OR Aug 25, 1:30pm             | August 25 1:30 PM       |
| August 25, 2022, 1:30pm OR Aug 25, 2022, 1:30pm | August 25, 2022 1:30 PM |
| From 1:30pm - 2:30pm                            | From 1:30 pm - 2:30 pm  |
| 11:50am UTC                                     | 11:50am UCT (+0)        |
| **(EXCEPTION)** 15:14:07 OR 15:14:07.549        | 03:14:07pm              |

## Abbreviating units of time

Spell out all units wherever possible.

If space is too limited, use the following standard abbreviations:

| Unit        | Preferred      | Abbreviation (when necessary) |
| ----------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Millisecond | 4 milliseconds | 4 ms                          |
| Seconds     | 5 seconds      | 5 s                           |
| Minutes     | 6 minutes      | 6 min                         |
| Hours       | 7 hours        | 7 h                           |
| Days        | 8 days         | 8 d                           |
| Weeks       | 9 weeks        | 9 wk                          |
| Months      | 10 months      | 10 mo                         |
| Years       | 11 years       | 11 yr                         |

## Decimals and fractions

-   Write fractional values in decimal form.
-   Round fractional numbers 2 decimal places to the right.
-   Include a leading 0 in decimal numbers less than 1.

| Do      | Don't     |
| ------- | --------- |
| 0.92 ms | .92 ms    |
| 16.23 s | 16.2822 s |

## Money

-   Omit the trailing decimal and 0s for whole dollar amounts.
-   Place the appropriate currency symbol before the dollar amount with no spaces.
-   When including currency with a price, the currency comes at the end with a space between it and the dollar amount.

| Do          | Don't       |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| \$32        | \$32.00     |
| \$32.75     | \---        |
| \$14.99 USD | USD \$14.99 |

## Percentages

-   Use the % symbol with no space between the number and symbol.
-   For fractional values in decimal form, always include a leading zero.

**EXCEPTION** - When pinpoint accuracy is necessary, as with Synthetics data, you can use use up to three decimal places in percentages.

| Do                      | Don't |
| ----------------------- | ----- |
| 25%                     | 25 %  |
| 0.3%                    | .3%   |
| **(EXCEPTION)** 62.356% | \---  |

## Phone numbers

Separate numbers with hyphens only.

| Do             | Don't          |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| 1-409-385-0225 | 1(409)385-0225 |
| 866-225-5262   | (866) 225-5262 |
| +33-673-668    | +33 673-668    |

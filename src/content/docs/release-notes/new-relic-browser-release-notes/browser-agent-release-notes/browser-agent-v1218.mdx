## Improvements

### Removed 3rd Party Cookies

The browser agent no longer uses 3rd party cookies to maintain and track session information.  1st party implementation using `window.sessionStorage` is now used, which is automatically cleared when a page session ends.

### LCP is no longer reported on initialliy hidden pages

LCP metrics are no longer reported on pages whose state is hidden at load time, such as tabs refreshing in the background of a focused tab.

### Async Module Loading

Individual features of the browser agent can now be dynamically loaded, enabled, or disabled at runtime.

### Removal of script tag injection

The agent no longer inserts other features into the page via a script tag insertion.  It now uses network requests to instiate other code modules.

### Polyfilling

Polyfills for IE11 have been included with the agent bundle.

## Bug Fixes

### Fixed issue with BrowserInteraction nodes generating circular references

BrowserInteractions no longer generate circular trees when they are self referential

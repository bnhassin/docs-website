## Improvements

### Allow `nr.info` to behave with bakwards compatibility to 1216

In versions 1217 & 1218, `nr.info` object configuration was required to be present on the page before the agent initialized.  Starting in 1219 support better backwards compatibility, `nr.info` can be treated the same way it was in previous versions, ie. present either before or after the initial agent script.

### Remove non-ASCII characters from build files

Built files now are scraped and cleaned of non-ASCII characters, to support older versions of the New Relic Python agent.

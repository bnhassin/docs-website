### New features and improvements
* Where applicable, existing instrumentation has been tested and verified as compatible with Jakarta EE 8. [900](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/900)
* Add new instrumentation to support Jetty 10. [936](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/936)
* Update to jfr-daemon 1.9.0 to address CVE-2020-29582 and improve CPU overhead. [937](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/937)
* Add support to pass a boolean environment variable `NEWRELIC_DEBUG` where setting it to `true` activates the debug configuration. [890](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/890)
* Improved performance by internally replacing regex replace with iterative char replace (thanks to @zowens for this contribution) [933](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/933)

### Fixes
* Update the `httpurlconnection` instrumentation to use newer distributed tracing APIs so that spans are correctly marked as external calls in distributed traces and contain the expected `http.*` attributes. [885](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/885)
* Illegal Access Exception is no longer thrown from apps using NR agent with scala 2.12 and Java 11. [876](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-java-agent/pull/876)
